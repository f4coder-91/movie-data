For this project, we’d like you to build a user interface, using HTML, and populate that with data from a JavaScript object. We’ve given you a data object below.

Make this project your own, what you build as an interface and how you choose to display the data is up to you.

We’d like you to include ways for the user to interact with the data. For example, you might allow the user to sort the movies by the year they were released, or add a new movie to the movieData object.

This week, we’d like you to start using Git in your terminal.

Requirements :
Store the object below in a JavaScript file in your codebase
Render the data onto the webpage with DOM Manipulation
Allow the user to affect the display of the data by interacting with the webpage
Allow the user to update the data stored in the object by interacting with the webpage
